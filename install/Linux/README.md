# Linux Setup

## Toolchain

Everything needed for the installation process should be in the script.

```
sh install.sh
```

For distributions that are not Ubuntu/Mint, you can take a look at the guide in the [Miosix Wiki](<https://miosix.org/wiki/index.php?title=Linux_Quick_Start>).

## IDE
Use any IDE or editor you want. If you have none, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) might be a good choice.
