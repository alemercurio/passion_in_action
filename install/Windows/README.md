# Windows Setup

## Miosix Toolchain
### Requirements
Before installing the Miosix Toolchain, you need to install some required software:
1. Perl  
http://strawberryperl.com/

2.  Git SCM  
https://git-scm.com/downloads  
During the installation process, keep the suggested settings, but do change the default text editor to one of your choice.

3. ST-Link Drivers  
ST-Link drivers can be downloaded from the [ST Website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html#), but you are required to sign-up on the website.
If you want to avoid the registration process, the same installer is provided in the `install/Windows/drivers` folder in this repo.

### Toolchain
Finally, download the toolchain from [Miosix's website](https://miosix.org/wiki/index.php?title=Miosix_Toolchain) (Miosix Toolchain Windows). Install it and the reboot your computer.

## Text Editors
We suggest using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).  
If you prefer something simpler and lighter, use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
